TODO List for Config
--------------------

- Support comments for directives
  Example:
    myDirective = myValue ; My comment here
  How ? Set comment as child of directive.
  Use the same name for the directive as for the comment (usually,
  they don't have names). Could maybe do the same for sections, then ?

- Recursively remove elements (use getItem ?)

- Container for DB

- Container for .plist
