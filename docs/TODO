TODO List for Config
--------------------

- I will move the logic for parsing and writing to the conf object.
  The container will then be a generic tree object that conf objects
  will be able to share. This way, it will be possible to parse a 
  PHP ini file and write it back as a PHP array.

- Use a flag to compare object references
  This will fix the bug I have with finding index for comments or blank
  elements.

- Support comments for directives
  Example:
    myDirective = myValue ; My comment here
  How ? Set comment as child of directive.
  Use the same name for the directive as for the comment (usually,
  they don't have names). Could maybe do the same for sections, then ?

- Recursively remove elements

- Container for XML

- Container for DB

- Is there an interest for multiline values in .ini files ?
  What kind of line separator then ?

- Container for .plist

- Finish DTD for form generator

- Finish form generation with HTML_QuickForm
