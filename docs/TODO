TODO List for Config
--------------------

- Support comments for directives
  Example:
    myDirective = myValue ; My comment here
  How ? Set comment as child of directive.
  Use the same name for the directive as for the comment (usually,
  they don't have names). Could maybe do the same for sections, then ?
  
- Is there an interest for multiline values in ini files ?
  What kind of line separator then ?

- Recursively remove elements

- Use a parser from one container and a toString from another
  (overload ?)

- Use a flag to compare object references

- Container for XML

- Container for DB

- Container for .plist

- Finish DTD for form generator

- Finish form generation with HTML_QuickForm
