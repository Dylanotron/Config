TODO List for Config
--------------------

- Use a flag to compare object references
  This will fix the bug I have with finding index for comments or blank
  elements. (ZE2)

- Support comments for directives
  Example:
    myDirective = myValue ; My comment here
  How ? Set comment as child of directive.
  Use the same name for the directive as for the comment (usually,
  they don't have names). Could maybe do the same for sections, then ?

- Recursively remove elements (use getItem ?)

- Container for XML

- Container for DB

- Container for .plist

- Fixes to ini and ini commented:
  + Multiple values for a key are separated by a comma
    followed by at least one spacing character.
  + String values may optionally be enclosed in quote characters
    (", decimal code 34). 
  + String values beginning or ending with spaces,
    or containing commas or semicolons, must be enclosed in quotes.
  + Quote and backslash ("\", decimal code 92) characters,
    as well as binary characters (decimal ranges 0..31, 127..159)
    appearing inside strings must be encoded.
  + A backslash followed by any combination of CR and LF
    characters is considered a continuation character.
